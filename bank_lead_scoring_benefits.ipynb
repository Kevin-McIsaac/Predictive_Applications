    "# How to profit from Data Science: Lead  Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "The [2015 McKinsey report](http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/telecommunications/our-insights/telcos-the-untapped-promise-of-big-data?cid=digistrat-eml-alt-mkq-mck-oth-1606) on the use of Big Data in global telecom companies showed 50% of organisation saw no increase in profitability, while 5% found significant benefit. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common problem is the Data Science opportunity is framed in the context of “Big Data”. This risks the project focusing too early on the “who & how” of storing and managing that \"Big Data\". This inevitabily leads to an IT centric project to deploy a massive IT infrastructure (e.g., data warehouse, data lake) that becomes disconnected from the original business problem and hence the bueinss benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "A better approach is to focus on the “Predictive Applications that enriches critical CRM activities\" to ensure the project is driven by the “what & why” of the business outcomes and remains a business, not technology, project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Enhancing the CRM Process\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical (simplified) CRM process look like this:\n",
    "![Enhancing the CRM Process](CRM_Lifecycle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under each CRM phases we have listed touch points where a Predictive Application can increase the effectiveness or efficiency of a critical CRM activity to boost revenue and/or lower cost.  Four common starting points are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __[Lead Scoring](http://jupyter1.datascienceinstitute.com.au:8888/notebooks/Notebooks/Predictive_Applications/bank_lead_scoring_benefits.ipynb)__: This is the process of ranking leads to prioritise sales resources on the customers who are most likely to buy now.  The benefits are increased sales ROI and conversion rate, which translate to a lower cost of sale and higher revenues. There is also the benefit of a happier, more engaged salesforce. \n",
    "* __[Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)](http://jupyter1.datascienceinstitute.com.au:8888/notebooks/Notebooks/Predictive_Applications/Online_Retail_CLV.ipynb)__: This is the present value of the future cash flows attributed to the customer during his/her entire relationship with the company. CLV is considered an essential business metric as it shifts focus from quarterly revenues to long-term profits.  Furthermore, the sum over all CLVs estimates the value of the customer base, which can then be managed as an asset.\n",
    "* __[Churn Prediction](http://jupyter1.datascienceinstitute.com.au:8888/notebooks/Notebooks/Predictive_Applications/customer-churn-prediction.ipynb)__: This answers the question “Which customers are most likely to leave in the next period?” Given the high cost of acquiring new customers there is a strong incentive to take action to retain a customer. Organisations typically employ retention actions (e.g., a targeted phone call or mailing campaigns), with offers of special benefits or discounts. The difficult questions becomes “who, how, and at what cost?” \n",
    "* __Recommendation Engine__: This predicts which products a prospect is likely to purchase based on past behaviour (e.g., past purchases, activity, ratings). It was made famous by Amazon and Netflix, who provide recommendations on what to buy or view. The benefit is high conversation rates and an increase in basket size. "

    "This notebook explore the benefits of Lead Scoring by comparing the converstion rate and return on investment for calling 20% of prospects on a contact list. Two approaches are compared: \n",
    "* Unscored: Take a random selection of 20% of the contact list\n",
    "* Scored: Score each prospect using a simple machine learning model and call the top 20%\n",
    "\n",
    "The contact list is taken from a real world banking example. The [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) contains 41k CRM records from a Portugues bank during the year 2010. "
